When we are building an Agent, we need it to remember its actions and the
result of those actions. For example, if it tries to create a calendar
event for a meeting and the API call fails due to an incorrect parameter
value that it provided, we want it to remember that the API call failed and
why. This way, it can correct the mistake and try again. If we have a
complex task that we break down into multiple steps, we need the Agent to
remember the results of each step to ensure that it can continue the task
from where it left off. Memory is crucial for Agents.
